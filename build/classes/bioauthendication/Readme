Biometric Authentication System
===============================

This system is a model of biometric authentication system that takes length data
from image processing of a picture of hand. Here we use 8 different length that 
can measure. Image processing part is not implemented here. After reading the 
image the data is sent to the system and check authentications.

Main Security feature here is the generating cipher from measurements. 

Cipher
------
    there are 8 values in the measurement list
    they are joined with '-' separator
        01-148-1875-171-10-6-
    then split this string in to substrings by '-' symbol.
        {01 148 1875 171 10 6}        
    each measurement is converted into binary format and XOR with a binary x =0011001100...
    the length of the x changes by equaling to each measurement.
    after that results are converted into decimal number. The length of the results also saved along with
    final decimal numbers.
    
    when authenticating, 
        check the measurements with available data 
            if 3 or more measurements are make difference with available date above 3mm.
            then authentication  will be fail.
